## The Heroic Traffic Changer’s Glorious Dedication to Dear Leader

### Synopsis

The game is set at two busy intersections in bustling Pyongyang. The player assumes control of two fresh new recruits to the prestigious People’s Department of Changing Traffic for Korean Honour, both looking to impress Dear Leader with their unwavering ability to redirect the flow of traffic. Failure is unacceptable. 

### Gameplay

Play takes place exclusively at the two intersections.

* Each traffic changer is controlled with one hand and four direction keys.
* traffic redirection at one intersection is enacted by first holding down a key for the lane to be directed, then holding down a key for the lane to be directed to.
* Traffic arrives at an intersection and waits patiently to be redirected to one of the three other lanes.
* Traffic that leaves one intersection arrives at the other from random directions.
* With this in mind, every car on screen is always in play, at one of either intersection.
* Gameplay difficulty increases with the gradual introduction of extras cars, crowding the system.
* Gameplay difficulty increases with the gradual introduction of novelty cars, affecting speed and traffic flow.
* With this in mind, there are no victory conditions, only defeat conditions. A crash or an unmanageable buildup results in a loss.
* Each car that leaves one intersection gives the player one point.
